# Snake Game in Java

A classic Snake game implemented in Java using the Apache NetBeans environment.

## Gameplay

- Control the snake using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
- Eat apples to grow and increase your score.
- Avoid running into walls, yourself, or dynamically appearing obstacles.
- The game tracks and stores the top 10 players (name + score) in a local database.

## Database Integration

The project uses a local database (configured via Apache NetBeans) to:
- Store the highest 10 scores.
- Record player names alongside their scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Swing)**
- **Apache NetBeans** (for development and DB integration)
- **JDBC** for database connectivity

## Documentation

The repository includes:
- A Hungarian-language documentation file
- Class diagrams
- Manual test cases

## Running the Project

1. Open the project in **Apache NetBeans**.
2. Make sure the database is running (can be started via NetBeans services).
3. Build and run the project to start the game.
